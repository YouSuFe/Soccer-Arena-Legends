# ‚öΩ Soccer Arena Legends
_A fast-paced Unity arena soccer game with combat abilities, unique characters, and hybrid first/third-person cameras._

## üéÆ Introduction

Soccer Arena Legends is a Unity-based prototype that blends **soccer mechanics** with **combat-inspired abilities** and **RPG-style progression**.  
It is designed for both **local practice** and **online multiplayer** using **Unity Netcode for GameObjects (NGO)** with **Unity Gaming Services (UGS) Relay + Lobby**.
‚öôÔ∏è Dedicated Server: The project also supports a Unity Dedicated Server build (UGS), but this repo only contains the client/host version. The dedicated server logic lives in a separate project.

Players join matches, select unique characters and weapons, then compete in team-based soccer-combat matches with **power-ups, goals, assists, and environmental goal logic**.

## üó∫Ô∏è Scene Management & Flow

The game is structured around **five core scenes**, each responsible for part of the experience:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Bootstrap
- Entry point: shows game title/name.  
- Minimal scene that immediately transitions into **NetBootstrap**.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ NetBootstrap
- **Core ‚Äúglue‚Äù scene**: sets up networking and application state.  
- Contains:
  - **NetworkManager** (NGO): manages network sessions, spawning, and authority.  
  - **ApplicationManager**: decides runtime mode: **Dedicated Server**, **Host**, or **Client**.  
- This ensures consistent startup logic whether running as a player client or dedicated host.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Menu
- Acts as a **lobby hub** where players can:  
  - Select game modes  
  - Host or join lobbies  
  - Pick teams  
- Contains **LobbyManager**:
  - Handles lobby creation, joining, and team balance logic.  
  - Example: If one team has 4 and the other has 2, only players joining the larger team can be redirected to balance (making it 3‚Äì3).  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note:** When a new lobby is created, it **does not appear automatically** in the list.  
  Players must **click the refresh button** to update the lobby list.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Character Selection
- Each team chooses **unique characters and weapons**.  
- Once a character or weapon is picked, it becomes unavailable to other players on the same team.  
- Ensures variety and prevents duplicate playstyles within a team.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Game
- The actual **arena soccer-combat match**.  
- Core gameplay includes:
  - Collectable **power-ups** on the field  
  - Two-team soccer with **goals, assists, and accidental goals**  
  - **Environmental hazards/goals** that affect scoring  
- All character/weapon abilities, ball mechanics, and damage mechanics are executed here.

### üó∫Ô∏è Architecture Overview
- **Player Controller**: Rigidbody Movement, Rigidbody physics, and input-driven rotation.  
- **State Machine**: Handles all movement such as grounded, airborne, dashing, and landing states.  
- **Ability System**: ScriptableObject-driven definitions with cooldowns and effects.  
- **Camera System**: Cinemachine-based with a switch handler for FP/TP.  
- **Networking Layer**: Relay allocation and player spawn manager.  
- **UI**: Dynamic HUD cooldowns and stats.
